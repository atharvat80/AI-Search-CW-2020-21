# üêú Ant Colony Optimization for TSP

My implementation of the ACO algorithm for TSP runs for a specified number of iterations, where the initial tour is generated using simulated annealing and improved upon by an elitist ant colony system where ants with a good tour deposit more pheromone and ants with bad tour deposit less pheromone.

# üß¨ Genetic Algorithm for TSP
My implementation of the genetic algorithm for TSP runs for a specified number of iterations, where the initial tour is generated using simulated annealing and randomly mutated to generate semi-random populations from which individuals are selected depending on their fitness to generate the successive populations.
